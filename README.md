# Search CPP Documentation

This extension is a fork from [kunalg](https://github.com/gursahani/search-cpp-documentation.git).

This is a handy tool to browse cppreference documentation from within vscode, instead of going to the browser to do so.
Use this extension to search for library and methods documentation of the C++ standard.

The keyboard shortcuts are ctrl+shift+A on Linux/Windows and cmd+shift+A on mac

Or you can access the documentation by going to the pallet ctrl+shift+P or cmd+shift+P and type `Search Cpp Reference`. A window will open besides the current editor and you can browse the cpp documentation.
