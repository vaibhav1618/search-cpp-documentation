# Search cplusplus documentation

This extension is a fork from [kunalg](https://github.com/gursahani/search-cpp-documentation.git)/[FederAndInk](https://github.com/FederAndInk/search-cpp-documentation).

This is a handy tool to browse C++ documentation in cplusplus.com from within vscode, instead of going to the browser to do so.
Use this extension to search for library and methods documentation of the C++ standard.

The keyboard shortcuts are ctrl+shift+A on Linux/Windows and cmd+shift+A on mac

Or you can access the documentation by going to the pallet ctrl+shift+P or cmd+shift+P and type `Search cplusplus documentation`. A window will open besides the current editor and you can browse the cpp documentation.

What's more provided by this fork:

- Perform the search on cplusplus.com instead of cppreference.com
